<img src="Pictures\benefits of playing badminton.jpeg" alt="player jump to hit the shuttlecock">

<p>According to study, playing a game of badminton will help you burn about 450 calories each hour as you 
  lunge, dive, run, and get your pulse racing. 
  The various motions engage your entire body, including your hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and core,
   to give you a strong cardio exercise. 
   Playing badminton is surely the most suitable sport for those whose main goal is weight loss.</p>

   <h3>2. Promote Social Being</h3>
   <p>The advantage of badminton is that it can be played outside as a fun activity with your family or friends at a gathering. 
    Instead of letting individuals become lost in the digital world, it brings people together and spice up their relationships. 
    You can also utilise your workout to socialise and catch up with friends and family.</p>

    <h3>3. Improve Mental Wellbeing</h3>
    <p>Engaging in badminton sport encourages the release of endorphins, which are our body's natural feel-good, joyful hormones. 
      In turn, this can enhance our general mood and sleep while lowering stress, worry, and sadness while or after playing badminton.
       Badminton is a social sport because it encourages player interaction and teamwork in singles and doubles rallies. 
       For senior players, this can be very helpful in overcoming loneliness.</p>

       <h3>4. Improve Heart Health</h3>
       <p>Your heart muscles become stronger when you play badminton consistently and hit opponents. 
        Additionally, it enhances blood flow through our veins and stimulates the heart. 
        It lowers cholesterol levels and lowers the chance of having a heart attack or stroke. 
        Additionally, this promotes blood flow and unclogs the heart's clogged walls.</p>

        <h3>5. Lower The Risk Of Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Playing badminton can lower your chances of getting type two diabetes as an adult. 
          It lessens the liver's ability to produce sugar, which lowers the body's fasting blood sugar.</p>

          <h3>6. Increased  Life Expectancy</h3>
          <p>Though badminton may appear to be just another sport, it has a wealth of long-lasting advantages.
            According to a 9,000-person research from Denmark, playing a racquet sport like badminton can add about six years to your life expectancy,
             compared to playing football, which can add four years to a person's life expectancy.</p>

             <h3>7. Improved Reflex Action</h3>
             <p>Being a rapid sport, it demands both quick physical and mental reflexes from one to the other. 
              Physically, you must move from one to the other in a matter of seconds, and mentally, you must quickly and accurately recall the shots. 
              Your quick responses will improve your daily thinking and living as well.</p>

              <h3>8. A Flexible Sport</h3>
              <p>No matter your physical condition or fitness level, everybody can play badminton. 
                By changing the tempo at which you're playing, you can select a greater or less demanding workout. 
                This is done to accommodate both your particular demands and the requirements and skills of the other participants.</p>

                <h3>9. Suitable For Child</h3>
                <p>Kids are adopting smart phones, tablets, and TVs as forms of entertainment as they become more tech aware. 
                  It can occasionally be challenging to inspire your kids to leave the house and engage in physical activity after school. 
                  You can teach kids the value of fitness and health while also teaching them new skills by taking them to a badminton match. 
                  Additionally, your entire family will be able to enjoy yourselves greatly as well as living a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                  <h3>10. Strengthen Bone</h3>
                  <p>Bone fracture risk is decreased by playing a healthy badminton match each day. 
                    Your bones' calcium matrix grows as a result of the back-and-forth motions of your hands, legs, and arms, strengthening the bones inside. 
                    The physical look is also improved because we are all only skeletons. 
                    While chasing the shuttlecock and moving quickly around the court can help youngsters and young people develop bone mass and density. 
                    Osteoporosis is less likely to develop in the future as a result.</p>

                    <p>To sum up, playing badminton has a lot of positive effects on your physical, mental, and social welfare.</p>

<h3>TIPS TO PLAY BADMINTON</h3>

</div>

<div class="tips">
  <p>
    <strong>1. WARM UP</strong>
    <br></br>
    First and foremost, make sure to warm up properly before playing any games of badminton. 
    To enable easy stretching, you must warm up your muscles. 
    This will prepare you for some fast-paced badminton and help you prevent avoidable injuries.
    Prior to playing, you should preferably do some dynamic stretching, light jogging or skipping.
  </p>
  <br></br>

  <strong>2. FAMILIAR YOURSELF WITH THE GRIP</strong>
  <P>
    Before you can execute any shot correctly, you must master the grip. 
    Get accustomed to how you hold the racquet in each position, whether it's forehand, backhand, or panhandle.
At home, practise it frequently. Simply take up your racquet, work on changing from forehand to backhand, and practise some fundamental shots. 
The more often you swap and find your grip, the more naturally you'll do it.
  </P>
  <br></br>
  <strong>3. RECOVER TO THE CENTER</strong>
  <p>
    Control is crucial in badminton; you always want to have command of the shuttle and the rally. 
    You don't want to be the one frantically chasing after the shuttle throughout the performance. 
    Instead, you should always be the player deciding where to play next from the centre of the court.
Always consider returning to the court's centre after each shot when you're playing. 
The court's centre may now shift depending on the circumstances. You are equally far from each corner of the court from the centre. 
This makes getting to the following shot simpler.
